"""
Quickselect is a selection algorithm to find the kth smallest element in an unordered list
Instead of recursing into both sides, as in quicksort,
Quickselect only recurses into one side â€“ the side with the element it is searching for.
Time complexity: average O(n) (comparing to O(nlogn) with quicksort), worst O(n^2) ()
However, for randomly chosen pivots, this worst case is very unlikely
